python is hight level interpreted ,general purpose programming language that is known for its simplility
readbiliity and flexibility
it was created by guido van rossum and first released in 1991

Features
1. Easy to Learn and Read -
	Python syntax is very similar to English, making it easy for beginners.
2. Interpreted Language	-
      You don’t need to compile Python —
       it runs line by line using an interpreter.
3. Dynamically Typed	-
      You don’t need to declare variable types (x = 10 is valid).
4. Cross-Platform	-
       Python works on Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.
5. Huge Standard Library	-
        Comes with modules for file handling, math, OS operations, etc.
6. Object-Oriented	-
         Supports classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
7. Open Source	-
         Free to download and use for everyone.
8. Extensible and Embeddable	-
         You can integrate Python with C, C++, and Java.
9. Supports GUI Programming	Libraries -
        like Tkinter, PyQt, and Kivy allow GUI app creation.
10. Large Community Support	-
         Millions of developers contribute tutorials, libraries, and tools.

 Python is Widely Used :-
 web development.
 cloud computing.
 data analysis.
 artificial intelligency.
 scientific computing and more.
 Game Development.
 Cyber Security.
 Machine Learning & AI.


Advantages:
Easy to learn and read
Interpreted & cross-platform	
Large standard library	
Strong community support	
Rapid development	
Great for AI, ML, and Data Science	

Disadvantages:
Slower execution speed
High memory usage
Not ideal for mobile development
Runtime errors possible
Weak in multi-threading
Weak in multi-threading
Slower database access

python syntax:-
python syntax referes to the set of rukes that define how python program is written and interpreted by the 
python interpreter.

comment:-
A comment in Python is a line of text ignored by the interpreter.
It is used only for humans to read and understand the code, not for Python to execute.
A comment is a piece of text in a program that starts with the symbol # or is enclosed
in triple quotes (''' or """), used to explain the code.

two main types of comments:
Single-line comments:
A single-line comment starts with a hash symbol #.
Everything written after # on that line is ignored by Python.
ex:
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")

Multi-line comments:
there are two ways to write multi-line comments:

a. Using # on Each Line

You can write multiple lines, each starting with #.

# This is a multi-line comment
# explaining the next few lines of code
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

b. Using Triple Quotes (''' or """)

Triple quotes can be used to create multi-line text blocks.
If the text is not assigned to a variable, Python ignores it, so it acts as a multi-line comment.

'''
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span across multiple lines.
Python will ignore this text.
'''
print("Python Comments Example")


Variable:
a variable acts like a container or box that holds some data
 (number, text, list, etc.) which can change during program execution.
 ex:
x = 10
y = 20
name = "Santhu"

print(x)
print(y)
print(name)

Variable names follow some rule:
Must start with a letter or underscore 
Cannot start with a number	
Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores	
Are case-sensitive	Age and age are different
Cannot use Python keywords like if, for, class, etc
