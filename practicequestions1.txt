1.Higher order function
A higher order function is a function that either takes another function as an argument 
or returns a function as its result.
It used to make code reusable and cleaner to handle asynchronous operations easily (like callback promises).
To allow functional programming style in javascript.

Built in higher order function
Map()- create a new array by applaying a function to each elememt
Ex:[1,2,3].map(x=> x*2) 
Filter() – filter array elements based on a condition it will create new array containg only
Ex: [1,2,3,4,5].filter(x => x%2 ===0)
For each()- executes a function an each element 
Ex : [1,2,3].foreach(x => consol.log(x)
Reduce()- reduce array element to a single  value
[1,2,3,4].reduce((a,b)=>a+b,0)
Sort()- sort element using a comparison function
Ex: [3,2,4,1].sort((a,b)=>a-b)


2 prototype:
Prototype is on object that allows other objects to inherit properties and methods.
Every javascript function which can be used as a custructor has a prototype property 
and every object created from that constructor has an internal link [prototype] pointing 
 to it This is called prototype based inheritance.
It work javascript first checks if that property exists on the object itself .
If not it looks for the property in the objects prototype.
This continues up the prototype chain until it reaches object prototype.
prototype chaining  is the process of travaersing the prototype chain to
 access the propertice anad method of an objects prototype and its parent prototype
It will be use we want to share methods or properties among all instances of an object
it will save the memory.
You are creating constructor functions or custom object types.
You want to understand or extend built in javascript objects like array , string etc…

Example :
function ATM(bankName) {
  this.bankName = bankName;
}
ATM.prototype.insertCard = function () {
  return "Card inserted";
};
ATM.prototype.enterPin = function () {
  return "PIN Entered";
};
ATM.prototype.withdraw = function (amount) {
 return "Withdrawing " + amount;
};
const sbiAtm = new ATM("SBI");
const hdfcAtm = new ATM("HDFC");
console.log(sbiAtm.withdraw(500)); 
console.log(hdfcAtm.withdraw(1000));

3.this  keyword

this refers to the object that is calling the function.
this in JavaScript refers to the current execution context.
Its value changes depending on how a function is invoked 
whether it’s inside an object, used with call/apply/bind,
used inside a constructor, used with event listeners, or used globally.
It always points to the object that owns the function at execution time.

1.Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function or block are global.
They are accessible anywhere in the program.
Ex:
let x = 10; 
function show() {
  console.log(x); 
}
show(); -*

2.Function Scope: Variables declared inside a function are accessible only inside that function.
Ex: function test() {
  let num = 5;  
  console.log(num);
}
test();

3. Block Scope
Variables declared inside {} with let or const are block-scoped.)
var is not block-scoped — only function-scoped.
Ex:
if (true) {
  var x = 10;
}
console.log(x); 

4. Lexical Scope (Closures)
A function can access variables from its parent scope, even if the parent function has finished execution.
Ex function outer() {
  let message = "Hello";

  function inner() {

    console.log(message);
  }

  inner();
}

outer();

5. Module Scope
Each JavaScript file (.js) is treated as a separate module.
Variables inside it are not global, they stay inside that module.
Ex: 
let a = 100; 
export default a;

6.Arrow Functions
Arrow functions do not create their own this.
They take this from the surrounding (lexical) scope.
Example
const user = {
  name: "Satish",
  show: () => {
    console.log(this.name); 
  }
};
user.show();

7. Explicit Binding (call, apply, bind)
You can manually set this using:
•	.call() → pass arguments one by one
•	.apply() → pass arguments in array
•	.bind() → returns new function with fixed this
Example
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello " + this.name);
}

const user = { name: "Satish" };

greet.call(user);
